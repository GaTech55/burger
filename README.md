## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an application that logs burgers using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The application follows the MVC design pattern and Handlebars to generate the HTML. From a user perspective they are able to submit new burgers and click a button to "devour" burgers which are tracked/saved in the database.

## Acceptance-Criteria

```md
Application should allow users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name the app will display it waiting to be devoured.

Each burger has a Devour It button that when clicked moves it to the devoured section.

All of the burgers are stored in the database.
```
